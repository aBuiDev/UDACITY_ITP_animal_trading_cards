		<h3>Armadillo</h3>

		<div class="textbox">
			<p id="italic">One of the most endangered animal species in the world; hunted and killed for it's unique carapace.</pid="italic">
			<ul>		
				<li><span>Scientific Name:</span> Dasypus novemcinctus</li>
				<li><span>Average Length:</span> 91 - 122cm</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan:</span> 12 - 15yrs</li>
				<li><span>Habitat:</span> Rainforests</li>

			<p id="linespacing">Armadillos are characterized by a leathery armour shell and long sharp claws for digging. They have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about 75 cm (30 in), including tail. The giant armadillo grows up to 150 cm (59 in) and weighs up to 54 kg (119 lb), while the pink fairy armadillo has a length of only 13–15 cm (5–6 in). When threatened by a predator, Tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball.</p>

		<h3>Honey Badger</h3>

		<div class="textbox">
			<p id="italic">World's most fearless animal; takes a snake bite, kills the snake, passes out due to snake poison, wakes up and eats the snake.</p>
			<ul>			
				<li><span>Scientific Name:</span> Mellivora capensis</li>
				<li><span>Average Length:</span> 100cm</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan:</span> 24yrs</li>
				<li><span>Habitat:</span> Adaptable</li>
			</ul>	
			<p id="linespacing">Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural predators because of its thick skin, strength and ferocious defensive abilities. It is listed as the "world's most fearless animal" in the 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>

		<h3>Jumping Spider</h3>
		<img src="jumping-spider 300x200px.png" alt="300x200px jumping spider image">
		<div class="textbox">
			<p id="italic">The cutest creepy spider in the world.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name:</span> Salticidae</li>
				<li><span>Average Length:</span> 1 - 25mm</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan:</span> 1yr</li>
				<li><span>Habitat:</span> Rainforests</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="linespacing">Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps.</p>
